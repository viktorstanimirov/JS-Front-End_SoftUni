        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in web development, providing meaning to the web content beyond the
            presentation layer. This article explores the core benefits of using semantic elements.

        <h1>Improved Accessibility</h1>
        <p>
            By using elements like &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; , and &lt;footer&gt; developers can create more accessible
            websites for people using screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        </p>

        <h1>SEO Benefits</h1>
        <p>
            Semantic markup improves the SEO of web pages by allowing search engines to better understand the content
            structure, leading to potentially higher rankings in search results.

        </p>

        <h1>Ease of Maintenance</h1>
        <p>
            Using semantic elements makes it easier for developers to read and maintain code, as the structure of the
            document is clearer and more intuitive.

        </p>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>
            The &lt;article&gt; element can be used independently of the rest of the web page content, making it ideal
            for blog posts, news articles, and more.
